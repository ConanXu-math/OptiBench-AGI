      "summary": "This paper presents exact Semi-Definite Program (SDP) reformulations for infinite-dimensional moment optimization problems involving a new class of piecewise Sum-of-Squares (SOS)-convex functions and projected spectrahedral support sets. These reformulations show that solving a single SDP finds the optimal value and an optimal probability measure of the original moment problem. This is done by establishing an SOS representation for the non-negativity of a piecewise SOS-convex function over a pro"

      "summary": "We propose a new relative-error inexact version of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for convex optimization. We prove the asymptotic convergence of our main algorithm as well as pointwise and ergodic iteration-complexities for residuals. We also justify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through some preliminary numerical experiments on regression problems."
